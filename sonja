Hi Mom, Eme, and Dec,

I received the following from Sonja on Messenger and wanted to share with you in case you would like to contribute memories of Helga. I recieved this over a week ago and am just getting back to Sonja now (I'll post what I wrote below). Hope you are well, mom we should talk soon. Dec, I hope Ferris has a wonderful birthday at Christie Pits. 

Love to you all,

Hello Briain,
My mother, Helga Bosse, passed away on May 26th. I and my daughter were with her at the time of her passing. I am writing an obituary for her which I will share with all who knew her.

I am asking for stories of fond, heartfelt, funny, peculiar, interesting, personal, crazy, wild, and touching memories from the people in her life. I will collect these stories and make a little book in honour of her. 

If you have a story or several stories to share about Helga, I would be most grateful if you would share it/them with me. 

You can write here. Or, send it via a voice message. You can also send the stories to me via email: sonjateuwen@gmail.com or via post. If you choose post, let me know and I will email you my street address.

I hope all is well with you. I hope to see you one day soon!

🙏🏻🎶💝🤗

Please share this with anyone who you know that knew Helga incase they would also like 

Dear Sonja,

So sorry for the delay. I just forwarded your message to my mom, Emer and Dec. I hope it is not too late to add my thoughts.

Talk soon. Sending hugs,

Briain <3

My memories of Helga go back to the time she worked as secretary to my dad in the University of Toronto in the early eighties. I recall how earnestly she carried out her duties (my father could be quite exacting and was a tough task master). When he experienced bouts of bipolar disorder, Helga had the knack of striking the right tone to expertly get him on course again. To that end, she was often called on to intervene when a potential disaster was looming on any given day.

Once when my parents were away Helga looked after us kids. I recall how gently she would wake me up in the morning, softly calling my name repeatedly until it finally registered that I was a mere mortal 14-year old and wasn't being serenaded by an angel! How sweet and soft she was! Later when I was going through a rough patch, Helga was always there as a friend and confident, as I negotiated my way through the quagmire of the teenage years. 

My path in life took me out of country and it wasn't until decades later that I encountered Helga again. At that time she was a neighbor to my mom and sister and we would cross paths as she used to cut through the backyard on her way to the main street of the town. It was always a treat to run into her as she exuded warmth of spirit and playfulness, poking fun and paying compliments all in the same breath. 

I count myself lucky to have known her, and would say the same about her as she generously said about me once; that [s]he is always "helping out" behind the scenes. <3

Wonderful instrument! I play clarinet (slightly) - that is fascinating and my new thing I've learned today.  Thanks Brian for taking  the time to respond - I was looking through his Facebook and I was unsure of your relationship to him so I felt compelled to reach out, just as a courtesy - he and I were indeed birth siblings, the only ones of us to share both parents.  We were separated and put up for adoption around age 3 and 5 and were lucky enough to find each other about 10 years ago. Funny enough, we were both adopted by academics and grew up within an hour of each other, unbeknownst to either of us.  I was raised an only child but there was always a piece of me missing and it was him.  Anywhoo, they say he died peacefully and at least all his struggles are behind him.  
Greetings from Cape Breton and thanks for letting me share - enjoy the day!

Ah yes, clarinet is a lovely sound as is the Irish flute. Plenty of music in your neck of the woods also ;)

Amazing to have grown up and then to have fortuitously found each other relatively late in life.

I grew up with Alphonse when he first was adopted and lived in the same neighborhood. Ben was my best friend between around 7 and 12 yrs old and my brother Rob and Alphonse inseperable during those years (two years younger than Ben and I).

Thanks for your thoughtful message. We all loved him and will miss him in our own ways.

I'm happy to share thoughts and memories of Fonzie sometime down the road.

I can understand this must be an emotional time for you. But so much the better that you two were reunited as adults.

Condolences and best regards
